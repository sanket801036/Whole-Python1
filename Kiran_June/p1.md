355.	Sure! Here’s a detailed overview of functional programming concepts with practical interview questions related to each topic:


356.	**Definition**: A function is a block of organized, reusable code that performs a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusability.

357.	**Example**:
358.	def greet(name):
359.	return f"Hello, {name}!"
360.	print(greet("Alice"))

361.	**Interview Questions**:

364.	How can you return multiple values from a function?
365.	Explain the importance of the `return` statement in a function.
366.	Can a function call another function? Provide an example.


367.	**Definition**: The scope of a variable determines the portion of the program where you can access a particular identifier. Variables declared outside a function are global, while variables declared inside a function are local.
368.	x = "global"
369.	def foo():
370.	x = "local"
371.	print(x)
372.	foo()
373.	print(x)

375.	What is the difference between local and global variables?
376.	How can you modify a global variable inside a function?
377.	Explain the `global` keyword with an example.
378.	What will happen if a variable has the same name in both local and global scopes?
379.	How do you access a global variable from within a nested function?


380.	**Definition**: A function defined inside another function is called a nested function. It has access to the variables of the enclosing function.

381.	**Example**:
382.	def outer():
383.	x = "local"
384.	def inner():
385.	print(x)
386.	inner()
387.	outer()

388.	**Interview Questions**:

391.	How can a nested function access variables from the outer function?
392.	Can you return a nested function from an outer function? Provide an example.
393.	How does the `nonlocal` keyword work in nested functions?


394.	**Definition**: Functions can accept parameters/arguments to process data.

395.	**Example**:
396.	def add(a, b):
397.	return a + b
398.	print(add(3, 4))

399.	**Interview Questions**:
400.	What are positional arguments?
401.	Explain keyword arguments with an example.
402.	What are default arguments? Provide an example.
403.	How can you pass an arbitrary number of arguments to a function?
404.	Explain the difference between `*args` and `**kwargs`.


405.	**Definition**: A lambda function is a small anonymous function defined using the `lambda` keyword. It can have any number of arguments but only one expression.
406.	**Example**:
407.	add = lambda x, y: x + y
408.	print(add(2, 3))

409.	**Interview Questions**:
410.	What is a lambda function?
411.	How does a lambda function differ from a regular function?
412.	Can you use lambda functions with higher-order functions? Provide an example.
413.	What are some common use cases for lambda functions?
414.	How can you write a lambda function with multiple lines of code?


415.	**Definition**: Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results.

416.	**Example**:
417.	def apply_function(func, value):
418.	return func(value)
419.	print(apply_function(lambda x: x * 2, 5))
