# 2. Exercise
# Functional Programming

# 1. Define function and give its advantages.
A function is a block of organized and reusable program code that performs a single, specific, and well- defined task. Python enables its programmers to break up a program into functions, each of which can be written more or less independently of the others. Therefore, the code of one function is completely insulated from the codes of the other functions.

Every function interfaces to the outside world in terms of how information is transferred to it and how results generated by the function are transmitted back from it. This interface is basically specified by the function name. For example, we have been using functions such as input() to take input from the user. print() to display some information on the screen, and int() to convert the user entered information into int datatype.

The advantage of using functions in Python is that they allow for code reusability, modularity, and readability. Functions encapsulate specific tasks, making it easier to understand and maintain the codebase. By breaking down a program into smaller, manageable functions, developers can avoid repetition and improve the overall structure of their code. Additionally, functions promote code organization and collaboration, as they allow for the sharing and reuse of code across different projects.

# 2. Can a function call another function? Justify your answer with the help of an example.
Yes, a function can call another function in Python. This is a fundamental concept in functional programming and allows for modular and reusable code.

Here's an example to illustrate this:

```python
def greet(name):
   
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

def welcome():
    
    greet("User")

# Calling the welcome function
welcome()


In this example, the `welcome` function calls the `greet` function. The `greet` function takes a `name` argument and prints a greeting message. When the `welcome` function is called, it executes the `greet` function with the argument `"User"`. The output of the program will be:
```
Hello, User!
```
This demonstrates how a function can call another function, allowing for modular and reusable code.

# 3. What do you understand by the term arguments? How do we pass them to a function?
The term "arguments" refers to the values that are passed to a function when it is called. These values are used within the function to perform specific tasks or calculations.
In Python, arguments can be passed to a function in several ways:
1. Positional Arguments: These are the arguments that are passed in the order they are defined in the function. For example:
def greet(name, age):
    print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")
greet("John", 25)
In this example, `"John"` and `25` are positional arguments passed to the `greet` function.

2. Keyword Arguments: These are arguments that are passed using their variable names. For example:

```python
def greet(name, age):
    print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")

greet(name="John", age=25)
```

In this example, `"John"` and `25` are keyword arguments passed to the `greet` function.

3. Default Arguments: These are arguments that have a default value assigned to them. If no value is provided when calling the function, the default value will be used. For example:

```python
def greet(name="User", age=0):
    print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")

greet()  # Output: Hello, User! You are 0 years old.
greet("John")  # Output: Hello, John! You are 0 years old.
greet("John", 25)  # Output: Hello, John! You are 25 years old.
```

In this example, `name` and `age` are default arguments with default values `"User"` and `0` respectively.

4. Variable-Length Arguments: These are arguments that can accept any number of arguments. They are denoted using `*` or `**` before the argument name. For example:

```python
def greet(*names):
    for name in names:
        print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("John", "Jane", "Mike")
```

In this example, `names` is a variable-length argument that accepts any number of positional arguments.

To pass arguments to a function, you can use the above mentioned methods. The order of positional and keyword arguments should be followed, and default arguments can be omitted if their default values are desired. Variable-length arguments can be used to accept any number of arguments.

# 4. What are user-defined functions? With the help of anexample illustrate how you can have such functions in your program.
User-defined functions are blocks of code that are created by the programmer to perform specific tasks or calculations. They are defined using the `def` keyword followed by the function name and a set of parentheses containing the function arguments.

Here's an example of a user-defined function in Python:

```python
def greet(name):
    """
    This function greets the user by printing a message.
    :param name: The name of the user
    """
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Calling the greet function
greet("John")
```

In this example, the `greet` function takes a single argument `name` and prints a greeting message using the provided name. The function is then called with the argument `"John"`.

User-defined functions can be used to break down a complex program into smaller, more manageable pieces. They allow for code reusability, modularity, and readability. By defining functions, programmers can encapsulate specific tasks and use them throughout their code.

In the given code snippet, the user-defined function `greet` is defined to take a single argument `name` and print a greeting message using the provided name. The function is then called with the argument `"John"`.
