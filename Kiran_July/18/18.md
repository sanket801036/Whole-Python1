# 1.what is oop
 =>It is a programming paradigm that uses objects, which are instances of classes, to organize code. In Python, everything is an object, and OOP allows you to structure your code in a way that models real-world entities and their interactions.

# 2.What is method and tyes of method explain with example
Methods are functions that are associated with a class or an object. They define the behavior of objects and perform operations on their data. Types of methods in Python include:

1. Instance methods: These methods are defined within a class and can access the instance variables and other methods of the class. They are called on an instance of the class and have access to the `self` parameter, which represents the instance.

2. Class methods: These methods are defined as `@classmethod` and are called on the class itself, not on an instance. They can access class variables and other class methods. They have access to the `cls` parameter, which represents the class.

3. Static methods: These methods are defined as `@staticmethod` and do not have access to the instance or class variables. They can be called on either an instance or the class. Static methods are used to perform utility functions or operations that do not require access to the class or instance.

Here's an example to illustrate the different types of methods:

```python
class MyClass:
    class_variable = "Class Variable"

    def __init__(self, instance_variable):
        self.instance_variable = instance_variable

    def instance_method(self):
        print(f"Instance Method: {self.instance_variable}")

    @classmethod
    def class_method(cls):
        print(f"Class Method: {cls.class_variable}")

    @staticmethod
    def static_method():
        print("Static Method: This is a utility function.")

# Creating an instance of MyClass
my_instance = MyClass("Instance Variable Value")

# Calling instance methods
my_instance.instance_method()  # Output: Instance Method: Instance Variable Value

# Calling class methods
MyClass.class_method()  # Output: Class Method: Class Variable

# Calling static methods
MyClass.static_method()  # Output: Static Method: This is a utility function.
```

Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class, called the superclass or parent class. The class that inherits these properties and behaviors is called the subclass or child class. Inheritance promotes code reuse, modularity, and hierarchical relationships between classes.

Here's an example to illustrate inheritance:

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        print("Animal makes a sound.")

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("Dog barks.")

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("Cat meows.")

# Creating instances of Dog and Cat
dog = Dog("Buddy")
cat = Cat("Whiskers")

# Calling the speak method on each instance
dog.speak()  # Output: Dog barks.
cat.speak()  # Output: Cat meows.
```

In this example, the `Animal` class is the superclass, and the `Dog` and `Cat` classes are the subclasses. Both `Dog` and `Cat` inherit the `name` attribute and the `speak` method from the `Animal` class. The `speak` method is overridden in each subclass to provide specific behavior.

# 3.what is inheritance explain with eaxample

Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class, called the superclass or parent class. The class that inherits these properties and behaviors is called the subclass or child class. Inheritance promotes code reuse, modularity, and hierarchical relationships between classes.

Here's an example to illustrate inheritance:

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        print("Animal makes a sound.")

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("Dog barks.")

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("Cat meows.")

# Creating instances of Dog and Cat
dog = Dog("Buddy")
cat = Cat("Whiskers")

# Calling the speak method on each instance
dog.speak()  # Output: Dog barks.
cat.speak()  # Output: Cat meows.
```

In this example, the `Animal` class is the superclass, and the `Dog` and `Cat` classes are the subclasses. Both `Dog` and `Cat` inherit the `name` attribute and the `speak` method from the `Animal` class. The `speak` method is overridden in each subclass to provide specific behavior.

Inheritance allows the child classes to inherit and extend the functionality of the parent class. It promotes code reuse by allowing the child classes to reuse the code defined in the parent class. Additionally, inheritance enables the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes, where a child class can inherit from multiple parent classes, forming a complex class hierarchy.
